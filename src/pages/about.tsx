                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    MARK !T is a solution developed for EMEA College to streamline the process of collecting student data during events organized by clubs and other departments. Previously, volunteers had to manually write down details such as admission number, name, roll number, department, and whether they are undergraduate or postgraduate students. This manual process was not only time-consuming but also prone to errors, especially during data sorting and entry into the attendance software.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    With MARK !T, volunteers can easily add students to the event list by entering their admission numbers. This significantly reduces the time and effort required for data collection. Additionally, multiple volunteers can simultaneously access a live table displaying student data, making coordination more efficient. The app also features a scan ID card functionality, allowing for even faster entry of admission numbers.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    One of the key features of MARK !T is its ability to export student data to PDF or Excel format, sorted by department and year. This feature ensures that the data is organized and easily accessible for further processing. Overall, MARK !T provides a user-friendly and efficient solution for managing student data during college events, enhancing the experience for both volunteers and the core team of the clubs.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    In addition to its event management capabilities, MARK !T also includes an admin panel for managing students and users. This panel allows administrators to control access, monitor activity, and perform various CRUD operations to maintain the system.
